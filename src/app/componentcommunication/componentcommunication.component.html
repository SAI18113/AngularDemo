<h1>Sharing data between child and parent directives and components</h1>
<br>
<p>A common pattern in Angular is sharing data between a parent component and one or more child components. Implement this pattern with the @Input() and @Output() decorators.</p>
<br>
<p>The parent-component serves as the context for the child-component.</p>
