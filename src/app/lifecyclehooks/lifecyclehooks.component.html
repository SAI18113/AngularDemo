<h1>Lifecycle hooks</h1>
<br>
<p>A component instance has a lifecycle that starts when Angular instantiates the component class and renders the
    component view along with its child views. The lifecycle continues with change detection, as Angular checks to see
    when data-bound properties change, and updates both the view and the component instance as needed. The lifecycle
    ends when Angular destroys the component instance and removes its rendered template from the DOM. Directives have a
    similar lifecycle, as Angular creates, updates, and destroys instances in the course of execution.</p>
<br>
<p>Your application can use lifecycle hook methods to tap into key events in the lifecycle of a component or directive
    to initialize new instances, initiate change detection when needed, respond to updates during change detection, and
    clean up before deletion of instances.</p>
<br>
<h1>Responding to lifecycle events</h1>
<br>
<p>Respond to events in the lifecycle of a component or directive by implementing one or more of the lifecycle hook
    interfaces in the Angular core library. The hooks give you the opportunity to act on a component or directive
    instance at the appropriate moment, as Angular creates, updates, or destroys that instance.</p>
<br>
<p>Each interface defines the prototype for a single hook method, whose name is the interface name prefixed with ng. For
    example, the OnInit interface has a hook method named ngOnInit(). If you implement this method in your component or
    directive class, Angular calls it shortly after checking the input properties for that component or directive for
    the first time.</p>
<br>
<h1>Lifecycle event sequence</h1>
<p>After your application instantiates a component or directive by calling its constructor, Angular calls the hook
    methods you have implemented at the appropriate point in the lifecycle of that instance.</p>
<br>
<p>Angular executes hook methods in the following sequence. Use them to perform the following kinds of operations.</p>
