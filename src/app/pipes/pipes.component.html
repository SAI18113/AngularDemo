<h1><b>Transforming Data Using Pipes</b></h1>
<br>
<p>
    Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display. Pipes are simple functions to
    use in template expressions to accept an input value and return a transformed value. Pipes are useful because you
    can use them throughout your application, while only declaring each pipe once. For example, you would use a pipe to
    show a date as April 15, 1988 rather than the raw string format.

    Angular provides built-in pipes for typical data transformations, including transformations for internationalization
    (i18n), which use locale information to format data. The following are commonly used built-in pipes for data
    formatting:
